# TypeScript Multilingual Backend

This project is a starter kit or boilerplate for every backend project. The architecture is based on best practices and has been used in some real projects in production mode.  
You can read the codes and get ideas, as well as fork and use it for your projects.  
If you found it useful don't forget to give a star and share it for your friends.

## Install

- Clone the project
- Run "npm i" or "yarn"
- Make a copy .env.sample and name it .env
- Put a MongoDB URI into .env file
- Create key pair files by this command: "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key" in the root directory. (Don't set passphrase)
- Run "npm start" or "yarn start"

## Usage
### Authentication

    {POST}
    /auth/register
    /auth/login
    /auth/admin_login
    /auth/logout

### Simple usage

    {GET}
    /users			// Show all users
    /users/1		// Show user with id 1
    
    {POST}
    /users			// Create a user
    
    {PUT}
    /users/1		// Update user with id 1
    
    {DELETE}
    /users/1		// Delete user with id 1
### Paginating

    {GET}
    /users?page=2&pageSize=10		// Show page 2 of users, 10 users in each page
### Sorting

    {GET}
    /users?sort=family		// Sort users by family ascending
    /users?sort=-_id		// Sort users by _id descending
    /users?sort=-name%20email	// Sort users by name descending and email ascending
### Get specific fields

    {GET}
    /users?fields=name%20family%20email	// Show name, family and email of users
    /users/1?fields=-email%20-name		// Show all user fields except name and email
### Searching and filtering

    {GET}
    /users?conditions={"name":"Jack"}			// Show all users with name "Jack"
    /users?conditions={"name":"John","family":"Doe"}	// Show all users with name "John" AND family "Doe"
    /users?conditions={"email":{"$regex":".*gmail.com"}}	// Show all users with Google email
You can use all [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) queries here, just remember to JSON.stringify them.

### Upload files

    {POST}
    /upload
Request body should contain "file" field, and an optional "type" field. The file should be in [Form Data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects#sending_files_using_a_formdata_object) format. If the type is available, it will be placed at the start of file name. Upload works over [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) system and you sould place access key, secret key, and endpoint in .env file.

## Writing new APIs
You can create your desired APIs and add them to this system easily. To do so, you need to follow these steps:

- Create interface
- Create model
- Create validator
- Add route

For example let's create a simple blog post API.

Creating interface

    // {interfaces/post.interface.ts}
    import {IUser} from '.';
    
    export interface IPost {
	    _id: string;
	    title: string;
	    content: string;
	    author: string | IUser;
    }
Adding new interface to the index of interfaces

    // {interface/index.ts}
    ...
    import {IPost} from './post.interface';
    ...
    export {
	    ...,
	    IPost
    }

Creating model

    // {models/post.model.ts}
    import mongoose, {Schema} from 'mongoose';
    import {IPost} from '../interfaces';
    
    const postSchema = new Schema({
	    title: {
		    type: String,
		    required: true
	    },
	    content: String,
	    author: {
		    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		    ref: 'User'
	    }
    }, {
	    timestamps: true
    });
    
    const Post = mongoose.model<IPost>('Post', postSchema);
    
    export default Post;
Adding model to the index of models

    // {models/index.ts}
    ...
    import Post from './post.model';
    ...
    export {
	    ...,
	    Post
    }

Creating validator

    // {validators/post.validator.ts}
    import {Joi} from 'celebrate';
    
    const PostFields = {
	    title: Joi.string().required(),
	    content: Joi.string().optional().allow(''),
	    author: Joi.string().required()
    }
    
    export const UserCreate = {  
	    body: Joi.object({...UserFields})  
    };
    
    // Update fields can be empty  
    export const UserUpdate = {  
	    body: Joi.object(UserFields).fork(Object.keys(UserFields), (schema => schema.optional()))  
    };
Adding validator to the index of validators

    // {validators/index.ts}
    ...
    import {PostCreate, PostUpdate} from './post.validator';
    ...
    export {
	    ...,
	    PostCreate,
	    PostUpdate
    }
Adding route

    // {api/routes/index.ts}
    ...
    general<Interface.IUser>(app, '/users', Model.User, Validator.UserCreate, Validator.UserUpdate);
    
    // insert new route here
    general<Interface.IPost>(app, '/posts', Model.Post, Validator.PostCreate, Validator.PostUpdate);
    ...
Now you can work with new posts API, and all the features above are available for your new API as well.

## Multi language fields
To specify a multi language field you can simply add it in multilingual fields helper.

    // {helpers/multilingualFields.ts}
    ...
    case 'Post':
	    fields = ['title'];
	    break;
    ...
Multilingual fields will be saved in database as a string that is JSON stringified of an object like this:

    {
	    "en": "Where are you",
	    "de": "Wo bist du"
    }
Specifying current locale is by sending "locale" variable as a cookie or in the query string. The default locale is "en".
Handling fields are performed out of the box by Multilingual utility, and you don't need to do anything about it. When getting data from the APIs it will give you just specified locale value, also you can create or update multilingual fields like a normal string in every locale and the system will handle it automatically.

## Access control
Access control in this project is based on RBAC. You can specify some roles and permissions each role has access to. Let's check out permission model.

    Permission {
	    role		// Role as a string
	    entity		// Model name as a string
	    allowed		// An array of permitted actions: create, read, update, delete
	    create		// And adding object for create fields
	    read		// An adding condition for read query
	    update_filter	// An adding condition for update query
	    update_update	// An adding object for update fields
	    delete		// An adding object for delete query

The five last  fields may be confusing. So I'm gonna explain how they work.
Consider a user wants to check his/her new notifications. He/she should have access of read to the notifications model, but should only see his/her notifications. We can implement it like this:

    const notifications = await Notification.find({
	    visited: false,
	    owner: currentUserId
    });
The access control line here is "owner: currentUserId", and the is comes from cookies. We're gonna place this condition in permission model. So the permission record will be like this:

    {
	    role: 'user',
	    entity: 'Notification',
	    allowed: ['read', 'delete'],
	    read: {owner: '$uid'}
    }
Now user can request to /notifications API and you can be sure he/she will get his/her own notifications, no need to handle permission manually, or write custom APIs for that. The system automatically adds conditions from permission model to every find or findOne queries.

Let's see how "create" works. The user creates a new post, so he/she sends post fields and you should save it by his/her id as author. Again you put "{author: $uid}" in create field of permission:

    {
	    role: 'user',
	    entity: 'Post',
	    allowed: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
	    create: {author: '$uid'}
    }

The fields user sends will be merged by this object, so he/she can't create a post by another user id, cause it will be replaced by his/her own id. Here is a complete record of user<->post permission:

    {
	    role: 'user',
	    entity: 'Post',
	    allowed: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
	    create: {author: '$uid'},
	    read: {},
	    update_filter: {author: '$uid'},
	    update_update: {author: '$uid'},
	    delete: {author: '$uid'},
    }

## Custom APIs
You can write custom APIs and use them alongside the general APIs. To do so:
- create a service that contains business logic in "services" directory.
- create a controller that turns request information to service params in "controllers" directory.
- create a route file in "api/routes" directory
- add your new route to the api index file before general routes
